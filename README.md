# csc360_MFR_bad_coding

## This is a joke.
The following project is an exercise in what **NOT** to do when it comes to best practices in coding.

### Best practices violated:
- **Make your code readable.**
   - All classes, variables, and methods have had their names obfuscated by random keysmashing.
- **Use names that reflect their content or their function.**
   - All classes, variables, and methods have had their names obfuscated by random keysmashing.
- **Use proper whitespace to enforce and visualize structure.**
   - All code has been compressed onto one line, and whitespace removed.
- **Define constants where appropriate.**
   - Constant values are hardcoded in as many different calculations (e.g. `40` has been replaced by `1+1+1...+1` 40 times.)
