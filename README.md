# csc360_MFR_bad_coding

## This is a joke.
The following project is an exercise in what **NOT** to do when it comes to best practices in coding.

### Best practices violated:
1. Make your code readable.
2. Do not abbreviate names to the point where it would be unclear.
3. Use meaningful names that reflect the function or content.
4. Use proper whitespace to enforce and visualize structure.
5. Define constants where appropriate.
6. Do not overcomment.
7. Don't undercomment.
8. Write understandable loops.
9. Organize `if` statements so as to be readable, encapsulating conditions in boolean variables if necessary.
10. Maintain consistent naming practices.
11. Respect code proximity by putting related code as near to each other as possible.

### How violated:
- Rules 1, 2, and 3 are all violated because all classes, variables, and methods have had their names obfuscated by random keysmashing.
   - By extension, rule 7 is also violated, because none of these obfuscated names are explained where it is required.
   - Rule 10 is also violated in the `Employee` class where type indicators are prefixed to attributes of the class that are mismatched with their actual type (`boolean_num_hours` is a float, for example).
- Rule 4 is violated because code for the `Hourly`, `Salary`, and `Contractor` classes (now `cfghfjk`, `PLACEHOLDER`, and `PLACEHOLDER`) has been compressed onto one line, and whitespace removed.
   - It is also violated in the `Staff` class, as unnecessary whitespace is included. 
- Rule 5 is violated because constant values are hardcoded in as many different calculations (e.g. `40` has been replaced by `1+1+1...+1` 40 times.)
- Rule 6 is violated in the `Employee` class (now `ghjkluyghjfjyutgjhfncf`) as every single line is overexplained, even when it is self explanatory.
   - For example: Every line of a function definition block is commented, pointing out the function signature, each curly brace, any assignment operations, and whitespace for visual clarity.
   - Even more egregious: Functions with no parameters are singled out by comments _within the parentheses themselves_ indicating that these functions take no arguments.
- Rule 8 is violated in `PLACEHOLDER`
