# csc360_MFR_bad_coding

## This is a joke.
The following project is an exercise in what **NOT** to do when it comes to best practices in coding.

### Best practices violated:
1. Make your code readable.
2. Do not abbreviate names to the point where it would be unclear.
3. Use meaningful names that reflect the function or content.
4. Use proper whitespace to enforce and visualize structure.
5. Define constants where appropriate.
6. 

### How violated:
- Rules 1, 2, and 3 are all violated because all classes, variables, and methods have had their names obfuscated by random keysmashing.
- Rule 4 is violated because all code has been compressed onto one line, and whitespace removed.
- Rule 5 is violated because constant values are hardcoded in as many different calculations (e.g. `40` has been replaced by `1+1+1...+1` 40 times.)
